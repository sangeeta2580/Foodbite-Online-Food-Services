        <p>The delivery service provider is usually a courier or logistics
            company that collaborates with the platform owner to provide food
            delivery to the customers. The delivery charges on orders are set
            by the delivery service provider. </p>
        <p>Many restaurants have their own pool of delivery
            agents and all they want is a platform to bring their
            offerings online. Online food ordering platforms functioning
            in accordance with the integrated model can easily cater to such restaurants.</p>

                <p class="center">Catering services are one of the popular services offered
                    to individual and business customers. It is a fast-growing industry across
                    the world with the demand for catering increasing by the passing months
                    and years. The catering services market was valued at $130 billion globally.
                    Its size is expected to increase at an annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6%.

                    Owing to COVID-19, the catering market has seen a downfall in 2020.
                    This is in line with the downturn in other sectors. However, analysis
                    reveals that there is an increasing demand for healthy food. This demand
                    is likely to spur the growth of this market in the coming months.</p>

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Bulk Ordering</h2>
                <p class="center">Buying food in large quantities, also known as bulk shopping,
                    is an excellent way to fill your pantry and fridge while cutting down
                    on food costs. Certain items are heavily discounted when purchased in
                    bulk, making it an economical habit that can save you a lot of money.
                    While some foods make ideal choices for bulk shopping due to their
                    long shelf lives or freezability, more perishable foods should be
                    bought in smaller quantities to avoid spoilage.</p>
